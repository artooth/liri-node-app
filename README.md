# liri-node-app

LIRI is similar to SIRI. However, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface, instead of a Speech Interpretation and Recogniation Interface (SIRI). LIRI works in the command line node app and gives you data back.  

LIRI will search OMDB for movies, Bands in Town for concerts and Spotify for songs.
